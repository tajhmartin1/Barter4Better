        Barter 4 Better is a bartering and trading website where           you can share clothing, food*, furniture, crafts, and              more! At zero cost!

        We are based in Harlem, thus bartering will take place             through in person transactions. However, trading in the            area is open to everyone! Our goal is to aim for a more            sustainable and eco-friendly marketplace in Harlem :)
