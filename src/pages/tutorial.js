  <h3>More about the Red Balloon Preschool</h3>
  
  <h4>You can barter with anyone for anything! In order to complete a successful transaction, you must be willing to trade something that is posted on your profile. This is to guarantee that each person knows exactly what they are purchasing. We want to make sure there is little to no miscommunication between buyers and sellers!

After the transaction is complete, you and the seller can arrange to meet in person at a public place to exchange goods. Please be safe in choosing a location!</h4>

<h4>
If you don’t have anything to barter with, you can directly buy the item  with a $2 transaction fee; this money will be donated to the Red Balloon Preschool in Harlem and it will help students with their tuition. u
</h4>

<h4>
The Red Balloon Preschool located in Harlem is a full-time daycare that provides care for many Harlem residents and Columbia employees. This childcare facility has a strong relationship with Columbia University, but they are now facing eviction by the very same institution that made it possible for them to exist. Your donations will help pay for a child’s tuition and help the Red Balloon Preschool stay in our community! Read more about the Red Balloon Preschool and their values here.
